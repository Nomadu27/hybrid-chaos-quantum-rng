# Security / Disclosure

Thank you for your interest. This repo intentionally contains only public, sanitized material. To request access to the private implementation, heavy test logs, or production artifacts:

1. Submit a responsible disclosure / request via email to: cb@steddycoin.com  or open an issue asking for NDA access.
2. For vulnerability reports please use HackerOne or the Cantina link if your finding is about Base / on-chain randomness:
   - Coinbase (HackerOne): https://hackerone.com/coinbase
   - Base / Cantina (web3): https://cantina.xyz/...
3. We will respond within 3 business days. We prefer to exchange a mutual NDA before sharing private parameters (e.g., BBS p/q, full prime generation logs).

**Important:** Do *not* open pull requests that include private keys, secret moduli, or credential material. We will close such PRs for security reasons.
